WeView
=======

The WeView library is a tool for auto layout of iOS UIs. It is an alternative to [iOS's built-in Auto Layout Mechanism](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/Articles/Introduction.html).

__TODO__

* We need to add more unit tests.
* We need to add more comments.
* We need to need to more strictly distinguish the concepts of "measurement" and "arrangement" in the the layouts, ie. around stretching, ignoring desired size, etc.
* We should elaborate the FAQ.
* We should provide another tutorial page describing how to break down a design into a WeView hierarchy.
